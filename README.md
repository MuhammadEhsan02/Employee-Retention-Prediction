- **images**: Contains visualizations generated during exploratory data analysis.
- **notebook**: Contains Jupyter notebooks with the code for data analysis and model building.

## Contents
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The notebook in the `notebook` folder contains the EDA process to identify variables impacting employee retention.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizations created during the analysis are stored in the `images` folder.
- **Logistic Regression Model**: The logistic regression model is built and evaluated using the HR analytics dataset.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-retention-analysis.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:
